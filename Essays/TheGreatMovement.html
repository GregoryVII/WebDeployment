      <h1>The Great Movement</h1>
      <p>
        in many ways and in many times we have been eyewitnesess from the things from above that we can't explain with our own words but with the experiences and style of life that we can grasp something to be shared with others. How can someone be able to share their experiences? through the words spoken and written and a fluent language to convey the message and change lives through it.
        life is full of moment that are stuck in our head finding place and memory to be saved and shape who we are because without some sort of storage no one can be able to know who they are now.
        Hard to believe but most of our personality it is based on the memories we have shaped through our story.
        Time is just the ilusion of events happening one after another.  There is no past but just the changes of the body and the memories of what happened in a certain state of the body. 
        Everything is in the body. outside the body there is no time because there is no longer a body to hold the information about the dids while it is operating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then who is able to transend time? The one who is able to trancend the body. How can someone be confident that there is more beyond the body?
        No one knows.
